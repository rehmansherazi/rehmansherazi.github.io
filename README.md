20+ years building, designing, and operating mission-critical infrastructure, platforms, and distributed systems. Currently at **DigitalOcean** engineering the systems that scale the cloud. I blend platform architecture with site reliability, treating operational engineering as a software discipline—building custom developer tooling, fail-safe automation frameworks, and intelligent CLI utilities that eliminate system toil, optimize architecture, and give engineering teams back their time.

## Projects

### cloudy — CloudOps Infrastructure CLI *(internal)*

A modular CLI built for DigitalOcean's CloudOps team to safely manage bare-metal server operations — power control, hypervisor admin, spare-capacity discovery, and VM diagnostics — from a single interface, replacing fragmented dashboards and one-off scripts.

- Safe path = fast path: read-only diagnostics run freely; state changes on production hardware require explicit peer-review confirmation
- Crash-recoverable power-cycle detects interrupted runs and restores hardware rather than leaving it half-configured
- Spare-capacity finder chains inventory search with live verification, flagging unverifiable results rather than guessing
- Credentials pulled from password manager on demand, never persisted; output adapts to light/dark terminal themes

### [NearVar — Incident Runbook & Environment Panel](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rehmansherazi.nearvar)

A persistent VS Code sidebar utility consolidating local shell environments, AWS profiles, and markdown playbooks into a single dashboard — built to eliminate human-error risks during critical on-call outages. Available on the VS Code Marketplace.

- Fail-safe terminal stream layer pastes scripts without automatic execution, preventing accidental production commands
- Unified sidebar panel for environment switching, runbook access, and shell profiles without leaving the editor

### [JobMatch](https://github.com/rehmansherazi/jobmatch) *(in development)*
AI-powered job discovery and resume tailoring pipeline. Fetches jobs from Adzuna and direct job boards, scores them against your resume using local TF-IDF and domain overlap scoring, and generates ATS-tailored resumes via Claude API. Fully self-hostable with a FastAPI dashboard, Docker packaging, user accounts, and run quota management.

### [SyncBridge](https://github.com/rehmansherazi/syncbridge)
Cross-platform IDE-to-browser toolchain that bridges local developer workspaces with web-based LLM chat interfaces. Syncs state and execution hooks between a local VS Code extension and a custom Chrome extension.

### KOIP — Infrastructure Intelligence Suite *(in development)*
Started as a Kubernetes resource optimiser. Evolved into a comprehensive infrastructure intelligence platform that maps, analyses, and optimises cost structures across multi-cloud and on-premise VMs, storage, and networking. Serves DevOps, CloudOps, FinOps, Billing, and CTO/CFO teams with automated savings snapshots — without compromising SRE-grade operational safety.

### CoreGraph *(proprietary)*
Architectural component engineered to map, manage, and visualise complex DAG relationships and infrastructure endpoints across platform networks. Powers the dependency and topology layer in KOIP.

### OAR Renewals — Service Catalog Operability Platform *(internal)*

Automates Operational Availability Review compliance across 1,200+ microservices at DigitalOcean — replacing a manual, error-prone process with a continuously running platform.

- Ingests a live service catalog hourly, validates documentation links, and checks for required operability metadata (PagerDuty, Jira, ownership)
- Per-service scoring with monthly health snapshots to track compliance trends over time
- Read-only Streamlit dashboard with filtering, pagination, and multi-format exports

### CO-Tooling-Bot — CloudOps Incident Response Platform *(internal)*

Consolidates 8–12 parallel SSH terminals and copy-paste workflows into a single CLI and lightweight web dashboard for hypervisor incident response at DigitalOcean.

- YAML-driven playbooks with automated escalation: SSH → serial console → IPMI → BMC → PDU
- Real-time integration with Atlantis, Shipyard, StackStorm, Slack, and PagerDuty
